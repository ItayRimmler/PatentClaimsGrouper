Patent,Claim
2,"A Method for a Media Gateway in connection to a backbone, comprising the steps of measuring a packet loss or a jitter associated with said backbone, receiving a call when the measured packet loss exceeds a predefined packet loss threshold or when the measured jitter exceeds a pre defined jitter threshold for said backbone"
2,"detecting an indication associated with the call, wherein the indication is based on a time period associated with the predefined packet loss threshold or the predefined jitter threshold"
2,indication associated with the call indicates that the measured packet loss exceeding the predefined packet loss threshold or the measured jitter exceeding the predefined jitter threshold is acceptable for the call for said time period.
2,"adjusting the Quality of Service (QoS) level for said call when deciding said call is admitted via a backbone, comprising the steps of measuring a packet loss or a jitter associated with it, receiving a call when the measured packet loss exceeds a predefined packet loss threshold or when the measured jitter exceeds a pre defined jitter threshold"
2,"based at least partially on the measured packet loss or the measured jitter and an indication associated with the call associated with the call, deciding whether said call is admitted to be routed via a backbone, comprising the steps of measuring a packet loss or a jitter associated with it, receiving a call when the measured packet loss exceeds a predefined packet loss threshold or when the measured jitter exceeds a pre defined jitter threshold"
2,indication associated with the call is received from an external source such as a Mobile Switching Centre Server.
